    "A refrigerator is the best place to store pistachios if you don't plan to eat them all right away. Package them in an airtight container (Ziplock, Tupperware, jar with tight lid) and they will stay fresh for up to a year. An airtight package helps prevent condensation, which would make them lose their crunch.",
